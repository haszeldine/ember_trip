- The schedule extractor class is provided through the constructor so it can be mocked to reduce
  the number of test cases this class needs to cover to only it's own behaviours

- All the methods are pure functions so it should be relatively simple to set up the tests to cover the cases

- Particular logic to test is around deriving the 'next' node
