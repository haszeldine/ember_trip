- selectRandom trip should have some coverage to check that the data models are built after the call
  as this is a slightly brittle pattern. If there was more time then perhaps I'd consider implementing
  more of a lazy load on the getters that would then be cached - though it introduces a similar
  problem of needing to clear the cache, but it would likely at least be a single statement that would do all

- Tests to check that listeners are fired for both of the cases

- Tests to check the potential error cases for each of the two repository access calls
