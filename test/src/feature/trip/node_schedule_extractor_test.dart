- These are all pure functions so should be fairly simple to behaviour test
  there are a fair few branches to cover, but most of the logic is shared between
  them all as well so could be a candidate for parameterising tests

- Defining the String for Est and Arr in this class was a mistake and should have been left to the view
  setting an enum here that the view can base off of instead
